# Writing Vulkan Every Day Until I Have A Rendering Engine
## Roadmap

This roadmap is intentionaly fluid and will be subject to revision and change as necessary.

#### Week 1:
- Project Setup
- Window Creation
- Basic Validation and Debugging
- VkInstance
- VkPhysicalDevice
- VkLogicalDevice

#### Week 2:
- VkQueue
- Strong Feature/Extension Filtering and Selection
- Engine Allocators

#### More weeks to come! (as I get a more concrete idea of where I am at)
